     <b>Aspose Maven Project</b> creates a new IntelliJ maven based project by fetching and referencing maven dependencies of <b>Aspose Java APIs</b>.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Aspose Maven Project Wizard</b> allows you to create Aspose Maven based project by selecting API(s) from Aspose Java product lines like Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Words for Java etc.<br/><br/>
        Once specific API is selected, its Maven Dependency reference is automatically fetched from Aspose Cloud Maven Repository and added in pom.xml of the maven project.<br/><br/>
         <New created project is ready to debug/evaluate, all references are automatically added.
        <br/>
        With this plugin, you never need to check for new releases of Aspose APIs. Whenever a new release is published and its maven dependency is available, latest maven dependencies will be used while creating new maven project.
